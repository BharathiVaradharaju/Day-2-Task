Difference between Document and Window Object in JavaScript:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Window manages browser interactions, while 
   Document acts as an interface for content manipulation.

2. The Window object is a global object in client-side JavaScript, 
   representing the browser window containing a DOM document and 
   acting as the root of the document object model. Where as 
   The Document object is the HTML document that appears in the 
   browser window and serves as an interface for interacting 
   with the web page’s content. The browser generates a 
   Document Object Model of a web page upon loading it.

3. The window object, supported by all browsers, represents 
  the browser’s window and automatically includes global 
  JavaScript objects, functions, and variables as members.
  Where as, The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a 
  platform-neutral interface that enables dynamic access and 
  updating of a document’s content, structure, and style by programs and scripts.

4. The Window object is responsible for managing global variables, 
  functions, and objects, providing methods for browser interaction and managing properties 
  related to frames, tabs, or windows, such as alert(), confirm(), setTimeout(), and setInterval().
  Where as, the DOM is a logical tree in a document, with methods 
  allowing programmatic access to change its structure, style, or content.

5. Examples of Window Object Methods:
   ---------------------------------
  window.open() - open a new window
  window.close() - close the current window

   Examples of Document Object Methods:
   ------------------------------------
  document.createElement(element//Create an HTML element
  document.removeChild(element)//Remove an HTML element
